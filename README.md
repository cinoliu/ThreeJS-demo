Three.js
Three.js is a JavaScript library used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. It uses WebGL, a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. Three.js provides a set of tools and abstractions that allow developers to create complex 3D scenes with ease, including cameras, lights, materials, geometry, and more.

Getting Started
To get started with Three.js, you can either download the library and include it in your project, or use a package manager like npm to install it:
npm install three

Once you have Three.js installed, you can create a simple 3D scene by creating a Scene, Camera, Renderer, and Geometry:
import * as THREE from 'three';

const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000 );
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0x00ff00 } );
const cube = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
scene.add( cube );

camera.position.z = 5;

function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame( animate );
  cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
  cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
  renderer.render( scene, camera );
}
animate();


Documentation
The official documentation for Three.js can be found on the official website. The documentation provides an extensive guide to using Three.js, including examples, tutorials, and API references.

Examples
The Three.js website also includes a gallery of examples showcasing the capabilities of the library. These examples provide a great starting point for creating your own 3D scenes and graphics.
